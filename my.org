  - [X] pass tests
  - [X] compare your failed code to the passed code, find differences
  - [X] check if lock is necessary (all tests passed without lock)
  - [X] check if cow bit is necessary for unwritable pages (unpassed)
  - [ ] find reason for memory leak

  for variables in global scope, lock is needed.

  garbage collector may be slow, but it really makes life easier.

  diff: spinlock is added to each page's reference count

- Note taken on [2022-08-02 Tue 01:00] \\
  diff: kalloc initialize ref count as 1
  kfree decrease ref count and free the page if count is 0

- Note taken on [2022-08-01 Mon 23:42] \\
  diff: add helper function to handle ref count with lock

- Note taken on [2022-08-02 Tue 00:28] \\
  diff: add helper function cow_check and cow_copy
  cow_copy calls cow_check to determine whether PTE's cow bit is set
  after that cow_copy simply alloc memory and do mapping

- Note taken on [2022-08-02 Tue 00:48] \\
  diff: these two helpers is well designed
  they are abstracted as functions whose parameters are pagetable and va
  one could tell whether the va refer to a cow page
  while the other make one copy of the page and return pa of the new

- Note taken on [2022-08-02 Tue 00:53] \\
  diff: uvmcopy just add_ref after map new va to the same pa

- Note taken on [2022-08-02 Tue 01:03] \\
  usertrap just call cow_copy if there is a page fault
  copy_out call cow_check and then call cow_copy if it's a cow page

- Note taken on [2022-08-07 Sun 07:25] \\
  all tests passed when lock removed
